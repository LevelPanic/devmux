# Contributing to devmux

Thanks for your interest in contributing. Here's how to get started.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LevelPanic/devmux.git
cd devmux
npm install
npm run dev    # watches and recompiles on change
```

The compiled output goes to `dist/`. The CLI entry point is `bin/devmux.js`, which imports `dist/cli.js`.

To test locally without installing globally:

```bash
node bin/devmux.js <command>
```

## Guidelines

- **Zero unnecessary dependencies.** The package has 2 runtime deps (`commander`, `tree-kill`). Think hard before adding another. If Node has a built-in, use it.
- **Cross-platform.** Must work on macOS, Linux, and Windows. No shell-specific commands (`tail`, `grep`, etc.) — use Node APIs.
- **Security-conscious.** Never interpolate user input into shell commands. Use `execFileSync` with array args. Validate all inputs that touch the filesystem or git.
- **Accessible output.** Respect `NO_COLOR`, check `isTTY`, provide ASCII fallback symbols.

## Making Changes

1. Create a branch for your change
2. Make your edits in `src/`
3. Run `npm run build` to verify it compiles
4. Test manually with `node bin/devmux.js`
5. Open a PR with a clear description of what changed and why

## Reporting Issues

Open an issue at https://github.com/LevelPanic/devmux/issues with:

- What you ran
- What you expected
- What actually happened
- Your OS and Node version (`node -v`)
